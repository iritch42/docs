#Starting your Telnet connection:

To begin, choose one of the following options based on the type of computer you are using.

>**Windows:** Open your Windows menu, type **cmd* into the search function, and press enter. 

>**Mac/Unix:** launch the Terminal application. 

You should now be looking at a DOS-prompt style window with a blinking cursor in the top left-hand corner, you will use this window to input the commands to initiate a telnet connection. Use the progression below to walk you through the connection.

#Things to know before initiating the Telnet Authentication:

1. For the first command in the telnet authentication test, **the "#" symbol will need to be replaced with one of our recommended ports.** We accept unencrypted and TLS connections on ports **25**, **587**, & **2525** and SSL encryption on **465**. 

2. You will be required to enter a base 64 encoded version of your SendGrid username and password. To encode your username and password, please visit the following URL: https://www.base64encode.org/
